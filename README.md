# Awesome things for students (and teachers, and everyone else)
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)<br />
This is currently in development, but should soon be a reasonably comprehensive list of awesome things that students can access (from free tools, to discounts).
Some of the listed services may also be avaliable via another service (eg - Bootstrap Studio can be claimed via the GitHub Student Pack, but you can also request a student license directly from the developer.)

**Key:**

| Icon | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| :arrow_up_small: | Free for students |
| :arrow_double_up: | Free for students & teachers |
| :heavy_check_mark: | Free for everyone (to some degree) |
| :moneybag:| Has a premium version or payment at some point * |

\* Some services such as Bootstrap Studio have been excluded from this as you get the product from being a student.
