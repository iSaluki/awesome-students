# Awesome things for students
This is currently in development, but should soon be a reasonably comprehensive list of awesome things that students can access (from free tools, to discounts).
Some of the listed services may also be avaliable via another service (eg - Bootstrap Studio can be claimed via the GitHub Student Pack, but you can also request a student license directly from the developer.)

**Top Services:**

[**GitHub Student Pack**](https://education.github.com/pack) - A wide range of resources avaliable to anyone who is a student, over the age of 13 and can prove that they are a student. Following the link mentioned here will take you to a directory where you can view all the included packages. If you would like to apply for access to this, then you can do so [HERE](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).

[**Bootstrap Studio**](https://bootstrapstudio.io/) - Create beautiful Bootstrap websites without the need for code. You can also host 2 websites with the student pack for free using a CNAME record or custom subdomain. Apply directly [HERE](https://bootstrapstudio.io/pages/student-license)

[**DigitalOcean**](https://www.digitalocean.com/) - A cloud platform for developers. You can host VMs (they call them droplets) as well as kubernetes, databases and much more for a fixed monthly price. ***NOTE:*** The GitHub Student Pack offers you $50 of credit for new accounts, however if you use [this link](https://m.do.co/c/0562a039be1b) or any other referral code, you can get $100 of credit for free. Credit from a referral code expires sooner.
